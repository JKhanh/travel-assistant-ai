# CI Pipeline Test

This file is created to test the CI pipeline implementation.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Push to main branch** - Should trigger CI pipeline
2. **Pull request** - Should run all CI checks before allowing merge
3. **Failed tests** - Should block merge
4. **Successful tests** - Should allow merge

## Expected CI Jobs

- ✅ Test & Lint
- ✅ Build (android)
- ✅ Build (ios)
- ✅ Build (web)
- ✅ Security Scan
- ✅ Melos Workspace

## Next Steps

1. Push this branch to GitHub
2. Create PR to main branch
3. Verify CI pipeline runs
4. Check artifact generation
5. Validate branch protection (if configured)
